        <h3>How To Train Your Dragon</h3>
        <p>
          The first movie of the trilogy was also the best one as far as I'm
          concerned. Some mistery and suspense, great action, and a cast full of
          lovable and unique characters make this piece a must see regardless of
          age. Based on a real book, its plot stands out among other animated
          films, delivering a memorable fun time for the whole family.

        <h3>Falling Down</h3>
        <p>
          This older movie is still incredible. Chills will run down your spine,
          as you watch the protagonist (a seemingly decent man) one day just
          snap under the pressure of his pathetic life in the city. In the
          course of the film, we are then faced with the ugliness, the filth,
          and the failure of modern society, as our hero tries to make his way
          back home to his estranged family. We are treated to witness how the
          so called American Dream really works out for the losers (and the
          winners) in their patented Rat Race. But in the end, too late, our
          hero discovers his own shame as well. That he always lived as he was
          told; only to be betrayed as they all lied to him.

        <h3>Interview With The Vampire</h3>
        <p>
          This is the only vamp film that I know of, that bothered to try
          conveying more than a cheap thrill of blood and suck. Therefore it
          gets my respect, but more importantly I still remember its key points
          and its ambience decades later.
